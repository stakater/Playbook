# Caveats

## Overview

This section contains the caveats in the current version of SealedSecret.

## ClusterRole Issue

It requires ClusterRole to watch the SealedSecrets. If ClusterRole is not provided, it doesn't operate and continually generates error regarding the cluster-scope RBAC issue.

SealedSecret team is working on a feature to restrict the controller watch to only selected namespaces.

We have given ClusterRole to the SealedSecret's service account with following rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: secrets-unsealer
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: "sealed-secret-name"
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - bitnami.com
    resources:
      - sealedsecrets
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
      - update
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - secrets
    verbs:
      - get
      - create
      - update
      - delete
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - events
    verbs:
      - create
      - patch
```

## Multi-tenancy

SealedSecret Controller uses ClusterRole to watch SealedSecret resources in all cluster namespaces, so therefore mutli-tenancy cannot be acheived.

## Where to Save Original Secrets

Again the question arises, where do we save the original secrets.


## Key Renewal / Rotation

Its keys are renewed after 30 days by default. New key will not be able to decrypt the old sealed secrets. So if a secret is deleted from a namespace then its controller will not be able to generate secret from the old sealed secret, which makes the old sealed secrets useless.

So, the user needs to generate new sealed secrets from the secrets again.

## Secret Key Security

If secret key is compromised, then your sealed secrets might get decrypted.

## Secret Key Storage

SealedSecert's key pair must be placed in a secure source like vaults etc.

## SealedSecrets Management

Before using SealedSecrets following questions must be answered:

1. Who will generate SealedSecrets?
2. Who will maintain it?

## No Sync as of Now

If one deletes the secret manually, it will not create it again, it only processes it once only
