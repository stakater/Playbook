# ElasticSearch Operator

## Introduction

### Chart

We use public chart of upmc-enterprises to deploy elasticsearch-operator in our cluster. [Here](https://github.com/upmc-enterprises/elasticsearch-operator/tree/master/charts/elasticsearch-operator) is the public chart repo. We use version `0.1.3` in our cluster.. We use umbrella charts to deploy elasticsearch-operator on our cluster. Currently we are using [this](https://github.com/stakater/stakaterkubelogging) repository for elasticsearch deployment

## Installation

### Installation Steps

It will have updated configurations and dependencies for elasticsearch-operator. But we can also install it manually (not recommended). To install elasticsearch-operator manually, clone [this](https://github.com/stakater/stakaterkubehelmLogging) repo and you can run the make targets of repo containing latest used implementation of elasticsearch-operator. This will install all dependencies and elasticsearch-operator as well.
