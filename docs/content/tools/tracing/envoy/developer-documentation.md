# Envoy

## Introduction
Envoy(sidecar container) is a high-performance proxy developed in C++ to mediate all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Istio leverages Envoyâ€™s many built-in features, like:

* Dynamic service discovery
* Load balancing
* TLS termination
* HTTP/2 and gRPC proxies
* Circuit breakers
* Health checks
* Staged rollouts with %-based traffic split
* Fault injection
* Rich metrics

Envoy is deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service in the same Kubernetes pod. Envoy allows Istio to extract a wealth of signals about traffic behavior as attributes. Istio can, in turn, use these attributes in Mixer to enforce policy decisions, and send them to monitoring systems to provide information about the behavior of the entire service mesh.

### Chart
Istio public helm [chart](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/install/kubernetes/helm/istio) version `1.1.0` is being used to deploy sidecar injector(envoy is injected by sidecar injector) on cluster. [StakaterKubeHelmTracing](https://github.com/stakater/StakaterKubeHelmTracing) repository is being used for deployment.
