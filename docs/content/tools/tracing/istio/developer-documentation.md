# Istio

## Introduction
Istio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies and aggregate telemetry data.

Istio components can be divided in two parts;

1- Data Plane

The data plane intercepts all inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) network traffic. Applications business logic, microservice is blissfully unaware of this fact. Istio's control plane components comprises two concepts:

- Envoy (sidecar container).

2- Control Plane

The control plane is responsible for being the authoritative source for configuration and policy and making the data plane usable in a cluster. Istioâ€™s control plane comprises three primary Istio services:

- Pilot
- Mixer
- Citadel (Authorization).
