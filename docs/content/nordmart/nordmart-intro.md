# NordMart Web Application

## Introduction

Nordmart is an online store web application built using Spring Boot, WildFly Swarm, Eclipse Vert.x, Node.js and AngularJS adopting the microservices architecture.

## Services

* **Web**: A Node.js/Angular front-end. Details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-web)

* **API Gateway**: Vert.x service aggregates API calls to back-end services and provides a reactive REST API for front-end. Details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-gateway-vertx)

* **Catalog**: Spring Boot service exposing REST API for the product catalog and product information. It uses MYSQL Database. Details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-catalog).

* **Inventory**: WildFly Swarm service exposing REST API for product's inventory status. It uses Postgres as the Database. Details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-inventory)

* **Cart**: Spring Boot service exposing REST API for shopping cart. It uses Postgres database. Details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-cart)

* **Review**: Spring Boot service exposing REST API for reviews on Products. It uses MongoDB as database. Details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review)

* **Search**: Spring Boot service exposing REST API to search products. It uses Elasticsearch as the Database. Details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-search)

* **Customer**: Spring Boot service exposing REST API to manage customer profile. It uses Cassandra as the Database. Details can be found on this [link](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-customer)


## Shared Dependencies

* **Keycloak**: Nordmart uses Keycloak to authenticate a user and get the Customer Profile. A user can go through products but he would have to Sign in to purchase an item.

* **Kafka**: Nordmart uses Kafka as the message broker, whenever a CRUD operation is performed in Catalog, it sends the message to Search Service using Kafka.
