# Introduction

Source versioning is a core activity in software development. It is also a foundation of devsecops automation.
 With technologies such as cloud infrastructure, build tools, CI tools, the move to declarative configuration
  and environments, source versioning is being used for more than just application code.

Distributed source versioning systems such as git are particularly suited to devsecops practices,
 as they provide a more agile and collaborative approach to source versioning.

Git has become the defacto versioning system of today, with a multitude of industry-grade cloud services available.
We use git as our versioning system, with Github for our open source projects.
