# Bootstrapping a Github Organization

## Steps 

1. Create a bot user on Github. 

2. Create an Organization on Github. 

3. Go to Settings -> Member Privileges -> Set the Following Properties

- Set Base permission as Read

- Disable Private & Public Repository Creation

- Disable `Allow members to change repository visibilities for this organization` & `Allow members to delete or transfer repositories for this organization`.

The above settings will disable repository creation for the organization members and disable members with admin privileges to change repository visibility or ability to transfer repositories.

4. Create a Repository `<organization-name>-github-config` which will have all the github infrastructure(Repos & User files) for your organization and the tfstate.

5. Setup Branch protection for your Repository so no one can commit into master directly rather create a PR and then have it approved and then merge it onto master.

Go to Repo -> Settings -> Branches -> Branch Protection Rule -> Add Rule. Set following values

- Branch Name Pattern: master
- Enable `Require pull request reviews before merging`, Set the number of approvers required, 1 is default and is enough.
- You can also enable `Require status checks to pass before merging`, so that whenever your PR is created, it should be approved by someone and also its pipeline(CI step) should pass, only then it can merge onto master. We will be creating CI/CD using Github Actions below, you can have your own status checks as well.

- These are some basic steps that we follow, you can add even more checks based on your organization criteria like signed commits, either this should be for administators as well or not.

Your branch protection page should look like following:

![Branch Protection](./image/branch-protection.png)

6. Add following files with their respective content in the repo.

**.gitignore:**

File to ignore the files in git

```sh
# Compiled files
terraform.tfvars
*.backup
.terraform
*.sh 
*.zip
```

**main.tf:**

File containing the providers for terraform.

```terraform
locals{
    github_organization = "<organization-name>"
}

provider "github" {
  organization = "${local.github_organization}"
  version = "1.2.1"
}

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.11.8"
}
```

These are the steps that are required to setup your organization. Furthermore, you would have to add users, create teams, create repositories and setup CI/CD for your repository. We recommend following ways, but you can have based on your team policy.


## Setup CI/CD using Github Actions

There are different tools through which we can setup CI/CD for our repository like Jenkins, CircleCI, Github Actions, etc. We are using Github Actions for now. You can use the following steps to create CI/CD for your terraform project on Github Actions

1. Create folder `.github` and subfolder `workflows` and then create 2 yaml files `ci.yml` and `cd.yml`. Your directory will be like 

```sh
.github/workflows/ci.yml
.github/workflows/cd.yml
.gitignore
README.md
main.tf
```

2. We will be using token of the bot user to create repos so login using bot user and create a Personal Access Token, Go to Profile(top right corner) -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Token and Generate New Token with all rights as through this we will be creating or might be deleting users and repositories. Copy the token.

3. Go to Repo -> Settings -> Secrets -> Add a Secret, Name should be `GITHUB_TERRAFORM_TOKEN` and value should be the token that you copied in Step 2.

4. In CI, we will just be validating and planning the terraform, just checking if the PR is fine or not so in `ci.yml`, add following content:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  terraform_plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')"
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Install Terraform
      env:
        TERRAFORM_VERSION: "0.11.11"
      run: |
        tf_version=$TERRAFORM_VERSION
        wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/"$tf_version"/terraform_"$tf_version"_linux_amd64.zip
        unzip terraform_"$tf_version"_linux_amd64.zip
        sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
    - name: Verify Terraform version
      run: terraform --version

    - name: Terraform init
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TERRAFORM_TOKEN }}
      run: terraform init -input=false

    - name: Terraform validation
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TERRAFORM_TOKEN }}
      run: terraform validate

    - name: Terraform plan
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TERRAFORM_TOKEN }}
      run: terraform plan
```

The above manifest will use the token to plan and validate your terraform files and if there is an error it will fail the pipeline. This will be run only for PRs to the master branch.

5. In CD, we actually apply the terraform files and save its state in tfstate file, so in cd.yml, copy following manifest

```yaml
name: CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  terraform_apply:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')"
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Install Terraform
      env:
        TERRAFORM_VERSION: "0.11.11"
      run: |
        tf_version=$TERRAFORM_VERSION
        wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/"$tf_version"/terraform_"$tf_version"_linux_amd64.zip
        unzip terraform_"$tf_version"_linux_amd64.zip
        sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
    - name: Verify Terraform version
      run: terraform --version

    - name: Terraform init
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TERRAFORM_TOKEN }}
      run: terraform init -input=false

    - name: Terraform validation
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TERRAFORM_TOKEN }}
      run: terraform validate

    - name: Terraform apply
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TERRAFORM_TOKEN }}
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false
    - name: Commit files
      if: always()  
      run: |
        git config --local user.email "startelvan.bot@gmail.com"
        git config --local user.name "Startelvan Bot"
        git add .
        git commit -m "Update tfstate skip ci" || true
    - name: Push changes
      if: always()
      uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TERRAFORM_TOKEN }}
```

This will only run when a change is committed onto master. It will initialize and apply the terraform manifest and push the changes back to git repository. So when terraform is applied and terraform updates the tfstate file it will push back the changes to the repo.

## How TOs

### Create a team

Add a file `team-developers.tf`, copy following manifest in it. Following file will create a `Developers` team, you can have it based on your own needs.

```terraform
# Github Team for Developers
resource "github_team" "developers" {
  name        = "Developers"
  description = "A cool team of developers"
  privacy = "closed"
}
```

### Add a User

One thing to note is module name should contain 
::: tip Note
`underscore (_) and not hyphen (-)`
:::

Add a file `user-<username>.tf`, copy following manifest in it.

```terraform
module "user_<user_name>" {
  source = "github.com/stakater/terraform-module-github.git//modules/user?ref=1.0.3"
  username = "<username>"
  team_id = "${github_team.developers.id}"
}
```

### Create a Repository

Add a file `repo-<repoName>.tf`, for repository there are a number of parameters that you might or might not want for your team, you can see the details below. 

One thing to note is module name should contain 

::: tip Note
`underscore (_) and not hyphen (-) whereas in repository name and file name you can use hyphen(-)`
:::

so when copying following manifest, take note of this.

```terraform
module "<repo_name>" {
  source         = "github.com/stakater/terraform-module-github.git//modules/repository?ref=1.0.10"
  name           = "<repo-name>"
  description = "<Your repo description>"
  homepage_url = ""
  license_template = ""
  team_id  = "${github_team.developers.id}"
  enable_branch_protection = true
  protected_branch_name = "master"
  enforce_admins = false
  status_checks = ["build"]  # name of the pipeline triggered check below
  require_status_checks = true
  has_wiki = false
  has_projects = false
  dismiss_stale_reviews = true
  require_code_owner_reviews = true
  archived = false
  has_downloads = true
  topics = ["stakater", "development", "golang"]
  private = true
  webhooks = []
}
```

**Details of Above Parameters:**

|       Key        | Type  |  Description |
| :---------------: | :--: | :-----------:|
| name                  | String | Name of the Repository |
| description | String  | Description of the Repository |
| homepage_url | String  | Url for your repository or company |
| license_template | String  | If want to set a license for the repository |
| team_id | String  | Id of team that should have access to the repository |
| enable_branch_protection | Boolean  | Whether the repo should master branch protection enabled |
| protected_branch_name | Boolean  | The branch that should be protected |
| enforce_admins | Boolean | Enforce branch protection rule on admins or not |
| status_checks | List of String | The status checks required to pass before merging a repo |
| require_status_checks | Boolean| Whether the branch protection should have status checks enabled or not |
| has_wiki | Boolean  | Contains Wiki or Not |
| has_projects | Boolean  | Consists of Projects or not |
| dismiss_stale_reviews | Boolean  | Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed |
| require_code_owner_reviews | Boolean  | Code Owner Review Required |
| archived | Boolean  | Is the repo archived or not |
| has_downloads | Boolean  | Does the repo contain downloads |
| has_projects | Boolean  | Consists of Projects or not |
| topics | Array of String  | Topics for the Repository |
| private | Boolean  | Repo should be private or public |
| webhooks | Array of Object | Webhooks to be added and their secrets |

**Sample Webhook Structure:**
```terraform
  webhooks = [
    {
      url = "https://jenkins.delivery.domain.com/github-webhook/",
      events = "push,pull_request"
      secret = "mySecret"
    }
  ]
```

Now the repository will be created, you can setup CI/CD in it. If you want to setup CI/CD through Github Actions, you can do the following:

1. Clone the repo
2. Create folders .github/workflow
3. Create a ci.yml, copy following content

```yml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')"
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: List
      run: ls
    - name: Build
      run: echo helloworld
```

The above will run on PRs for any branch and its name is `build`, used in the `status_checks` parameter above.

### Creating PR & Pushing changes

Create a new branch and push your changes to it, and then create a PR for it, PR will trigger a CI pipeline, which will run following steps:

```sh
terraform init -input=false
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

If pipeline passes, you can approve the PR from another member and only then you can merge it to the master branch, which will run the CD pipeline which will actually create the user in the organization and make it a member of team. The CD pipeline does the following steps:

```sh
terraform init -input=false
terraform validate
terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false
Push the changes
```
