## Overview

This guide provides guideline on how to configure Github repository with Gitlab CI/CD pipeline.

* Make sure that Gitlab account user must have the access to Github repositories.

* Create a new project in Gitlab.

* Select `CI/CD for external repo` from `New Project` dashboard.

* It provides further two options on how connect the new project with remote repository:

  1. Github.

  2. git Repo by URL.

* Select the `Github` option, it will show list of repositories. Select any one repository to configure its pipeline. Gitlab with sync the project.

* Gitlab provides following feature for synced project:

  * Import the project.
  * Enable [Pull Mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/repository_mirroring.html#pulling-from-a-remote-repository-starter).
  * Enable [GitHub project integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/github.html).
  * Create a web hook on GitHub to notify GitLab of new commits.

* Gitlab pipeline provides `Git shallow clone` feature which can be used to pull x number of changes from repository. Its default value is `50`, but in this scenario all change are required so therefore `0` (means to pull all the changes) will be configured. Go to `Project -> Settings -> CI/CD -> General pipelines -> Git shallow clone` location and change its value.
