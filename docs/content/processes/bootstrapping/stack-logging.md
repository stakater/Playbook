# Stack: Logging

## Overview
This document provides guidelines about the configuration required to deploy Logging stack on the kubernetes cluster.

## Details
Logging Stack details can found on this [link](/content/tools/logging/cerebro/developer-documentation.html#introduction).

## Configuration

This section provides high level overview of configuration: 

* Logging stack [repository](https://github.com/stakater/StakaterKubeHelmLogging) resides on Github.

* Logging stack can be deployed by Jenkins but in a new deployment when jenkins is not available, we need some online service like Bitbucket or Gitlab CI/CD pipeline. Currently, we are only supporting Gitlab.

## Deployment

Details about Logging Stack deployment are provided on this [guide](/content/processes/bootstrapping/deploying-stakater-stacks.html).
