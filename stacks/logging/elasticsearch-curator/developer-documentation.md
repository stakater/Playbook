# Elasticsearch Curator

## Introduction

Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage your elasticsearch indices. In Stakater we use curator to remove our older logs; letâ€™s say 2 months old elasticsearch indices.

### Chart

We use public helm chart of elasticsearch-curator to deploy elasticsearch in our cluster. [Here](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/elasticsearch-curator) is the public chart repo.
We use version `1.0.1` in our cluster. We use umbrella charts to deploy elasticsearch curator on our cluster. Currently we are using [this](https://github.com/stakater/stakaterkubelogging) repository for elasticsearch curator deployment

### Image

Currently we are using this `quay.io/pires/docker-elasticsearch-curator:5.5.4` public image for elasticsearch-curator in stakater.

## Installation

### Installation Steps

Most of the times elasticsearch-curator will be deployed from pipeline of [this](https://github.com/stakater/stakaterkubehelmLogging) repository. It will have updated configurations and dependencies for elasticsearch-curator. But we can also install it manually (not recommended). To install elasticsearch-curator manually, clone [this](https://github.com/stakater/stakaterkubehelmLogging) repo and you can run the make targets of repo containing latest used implementation of elasticsearch-curator. This will install all dependencies and elasticsearch-curator as well.

1. Clone `https://github.com/stakater/stakaterkubehelmLogging` repository
2. Update the hardcoded values mentioned [here](#Hard-coded-values)
3. Run this command. `make install CHART_NAME=logging`
