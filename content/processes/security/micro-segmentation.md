# Micro-segmentation

Micro-segmentation enables consolidation of workloads with differing security needs. An example could be running workloads of a production environment with a test environment, or within an application environment, running public and private components.

This is implemented by enforcing security policies around each individual workload in the environment. By placing security controls next to the workloads themselves, security policies become asset-specific and as a result, workloads at different security levels can now share common infrastructure, enabling much greater consolidation and agility.

Micro-segmentation is an emerging security best practice that offers a number of advantages over more established approaches. The added granularity that micro-segmentation offers is essential at a time when many organizations are adopting cloud services and new deployment options like containers that make traditional perimeter security less relevant.
