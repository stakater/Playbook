# Stack: Tracing

[[toc]]

## Overview
This document provides guidelines about the configuration required to deploy Tracing stack on the kubernetes cluster.

## Details
Tracing Stack details can found on this [link](http://127.0.0.1:8080/content/tools/tracing/istio/developer-documentation.html).

## Configuration

This section provides high level overview of configuration: 

* Tracing stack [repository](https://github.com/stakater/StakaterKubeHelmTracing) resides on Github.

* Tracing stack can be deployed by Jenkins but in a new deployment when jenkins is not available, we need some online service like Bitbucket or Gitlab CI/CD pipeline. Currently, we are only supporting Gitlab.

## Deployment

Details about Tracing Stack deployment are provided on this [guide](/content/processes/bootstrapping/deploying-stakater-stacks.html).
