# Stack: Monitoring

[[toc]]

## Overview
This document provides guidelines about the configuration required to deploy Monitoring stack on the kubernetes cluster.

## Details
Monitoring Stack details can found on this [link](/content/tools/monitoring/prometheus-operator/developer-documentation.html).

## Configuration

This section provides high level overview of configuration: 

* Monitoring stack [repository](https://github.com/stakater/StakaterKubeHelmMonitoring) resides on Github.

* Monitoring stack can be deployed by Jenkins but in a new deployment when jenkins is not available, we need some online service like Bitbucket or Gitlab CI/CD pipeline. Currently, we are only supporting Gitlab.

## Deployment

Details about Monitoring Stack deployment are provided on this [guide](/content/processes/bootstrapping/deploying-stakater-stacks.html).
