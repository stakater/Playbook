# Introduction

Alerting is one of the components of DevOps that allows stakeholders to easily observe important system events. Alerting is indispensable for modern DevOps teams due to the needs of continuous deployment of multiple applications composed of microservices. Alerting helps with reliability by informing us about the system at important states. That way we have confidence by having insight into the exact state of the system, and knowing when there are any issues that might be occurring, or could be imminent. Alerting systems can be configured to notify at the occurrence of specific system events (e.g. service down), or when thresholds of certain metrics are reached (e.g. 80% memory consumed). And notifications of such events can be connected various channels such as email, Instant Message, or even Text message on phones.
