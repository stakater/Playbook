We are using this one helm chart to deploy all the monitoring components:

- **Prometheus**: It is an opensource monitoring solution for metrics and alerting.

- **Service Monitors**: CRD to generate prometheus configuration to monitor Kubernetes services.

- **AlertManager**: It is part of Prometheus's alerting feature. Alert rules are defined in Prometheus server that send alerts to Alertmanager. Once alerts are received Alertmanager can group, inhibit or silence them.

- **Node Exporter**: Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels, with pluggable metric collectors.

- **Kube State Metrics**: It is a service that generates metrics about kubernetes objects by using Kubebernetes API server.

- **Grafana**: Grafana is an open source metric analytics & visualization suite with support for Elasticsearch, Prometheus etc. Currently, it is being used with Prometheus.
