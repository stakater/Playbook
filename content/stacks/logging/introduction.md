# Introduction

Logging is one of the pillars of observability. In the simplest sense logging is about recording discrete events. An monitoring these logs is important as they provide detailed information about events and errors that are useful to understand the flow of events that occurs in the application, and where and why the normal flow gets disrupted in case of an error. Application logs are usually generated with different levels of severity such as ERROR, WARN, INFO, etc. which are useful to indicate what the impact of the logged event is, and the level of attention that should be given to it. Apart from application logs, it is also prudent to monitor logs from the rest of the application environment such as middleware, application servers, and also system logs. This will help provide a complete picture not just confined to the application. And therefore a system level issue impacting the application may also be captured and observed.
At Stakater we use open source tools for internal use as well as our customer implementations, and for log monitoring our stack of choice is EFK (short for Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana). EFK. While Elasticsearch and Kibana are used to index, search and visualize the logs, Fluentd is the log aggregator, essentially going door to door and collecting all the logs that are configured to be collected.
