# Rbac

This chart will be deprecated soon. We used it initially because public helm charts had limited functionality, and to achieve our desired workflow we used it temporarily

## Introduction

[rbac](https://github.com/stakater-charts/rbac) is a helper chart that is used in conjunction with other charts. This chart provides support for additional rbac resources.  i.e. additional role, rolebinding etc.

### Chart

[rbac](https://github.com/stakater-charts/rbac) chart should not be deployed as a standalone chart. It should always be deployed as a helper chart. Always use the latest version of rbac chart, as it is maintained by stakater.
